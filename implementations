The contact form consists of three main inputs—name, email, and message—each implemented as HTML form controls with associated labels to support accessibility. Laravel’s server-side validation is integrated directly into the form, where validation errors for each field are captured and conditionally displayed using the @error Blade directive. This ensures that users receive immediate feedback on invalid input without losing their previously entered data, thanks to the old() helper function which repopulates the form fields after submission failures.
